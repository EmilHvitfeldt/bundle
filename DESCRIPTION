Description: Typically, models in R exist in memory and can be saved via
    native R serialization. However, some models store information in locations 
    that cannot be saved using R serialization alone. The goal of 'bundle' is 
    to provide a common API to capture this information, situate it within a 
    portable object, and restore it for use in new settings.
